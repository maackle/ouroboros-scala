===============

I participated in Global Game Jam 2012, and our team developed a super-ambitious game that we didn't finish.  It also didn't run very well because we wrote it in Python/Pygame, and it was impossible to package.  So, this is a complete rewrite that I did on top of my budding Scala game engine, *scalene*.  The game is not complete, it was just a test of the engine so far.
